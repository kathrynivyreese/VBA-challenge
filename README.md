# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge-Data Analytics

I collaborated with my classmate Matthew Fontaine to make sure we had proper syntax for multiple sheets.
Tyler Ford explained to me the need for the "ticker_count" variable and it's use in repeated loops.
The dynamic max code came from Xpert the AI.

I have provided two different files for my vbs code, as the instructions weren't clear about what would be most convenient for graders.

Note for the grader:
  The example images for the assignment did not include color formatting for the "percent change" column, but the rubric did have 10   pts attached to that requirement. 
  The complexity of filling the third table for each ws. didn't feel worth the points. Happy to take the deduction.
